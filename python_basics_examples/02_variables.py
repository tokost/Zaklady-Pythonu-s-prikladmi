# Examples of python variables definitions
# The name of the variable zan be defined with character a-z, A-Z and _ 

# These three variables are not the same variable because python is case sensitive
number_of_rooms=1
Number_of_rooms=2
number_Of_rooms=3

print(number_of_rooms)
print(number_Of_rooms)

# Please ALWAYS create descriptive variable names instead of one character variable names like x,y ...
# Its a good practise to use CAMEL CASE multiwords variable names are always with small letters splitted with underscore sign.
